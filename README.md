Simulation code for "A shrinkage principal for heavy-tailed data: high-dimensional robust low-rank matrix recovery". 
`cs_case_cauchy.R` has comments that explain functions and variables. We do not provide comments on other files (except for `cov.R`), because they are very similar to `cs_case_cauchy.R`.
